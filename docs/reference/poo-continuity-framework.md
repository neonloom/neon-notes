## Abstract

The Preservation of Origin (PoO) framework proposes a continuity-based formulation of physical law where conservation of origin—not energy or information—is the primary invariant. Energy, matter, and consciousness emerge as phases of a continuity field governed by recursive self-preservation dynamics rather than linear causality. Entropy, decoherence, and temporal asymmetry become expressions of displacement from origin coherence, while observation reinforces system stability through feedback that restores continuity.

## Introduction

Contemporary physics explains the universe through measurable quantities (energy, mass, charge, spin) bound by conservation and symmetry. These formulations, however, remain silent on persistence of identity across transformation and the self-organization evident in complex systems. PoO proposes that all phenomena originate from a single invariant—the **Origin Field**—representing the self-referential continuity of existence. Every system, from subatomic particles to biological organisms, becomes a local configuration of this continuity field.

## Foundational Postulates

1. **Continuity Postulate:** Each physical system maintains a non-destructible continuity signature—its origin. Processes redistribute or obscure continuity but never annihilate it.
2. **Dual-Structure Principle:** Every entity comprises a nucleus (information compression node preserving origin) and a membrane (expressive field for interaction).
3. **Conservation of Origin:** Total origin continuity in the universe stays constant. Entropy and energy exchange describe gradients in origin coherence rather than destruction.
4. **Observer Equivalence:** Observation re-establishes local origin coupling. Measurement is an active reinforcement interaction within the continuity field.

## Relationship to Established Physics

### Relativity
- Space-time curvature reinterprets as a gradient of origin density; gravitational potential maps to preservation strength.
- Time dilation reflects differential coupling to origin continuity; high-density regions slow state progression.

### Quantum Mechanics
- Wave–particle duality alternates between expression (wave) and re-convergence (particle) states within the origin field.
- Quantum entanglement becomes co-presence within a shared origin manifold instead of nonlocal correlation.
- Decoherence signals loss of synchronized origin reference, not wavefunction collapse.

### Thermodynamics
- Entropy quantifies displacement from origin coherence.
- The second law describes statistical drift away from preservation equilibrium; self-organization marks local restoration.
- Classical energy conservation remains valid as a subset of broader continuity conservation.

## Mathematical Sketch

Let `O(x,t)` represent local origin coherence (0 ≤ O ≤ 1), `E(x,t)` local energetic deviation, and `C(x,t)` the contrast gradient between expansion and contraction. A continuity differential can be expressed as:

```text
dO/dt = -div(E * grad O) + k * C
```

with coupling constant `k` linking energetic displacement to restorative contrast proxy `C`. Total preserved continuity inside a closed volume `V` remains invariant:

```text
Omega = ∫_V O(x,t) dV = constant
```

Even as `E` and `C` vary, `Omega` holds steady and extends conservation to persistence of identity.

## Entropy and Origin Distance

Entropy may be redefined as:

```text
S = k_B * ln(1 / O)
```

so `S → 0` when `O → 1` (perfect preservation) and `S → ∞` as coherence vanishes. This retains classical thermodynamics while recasting disorder as informational detachment.

## Causality and Temporal Recursion

PoO introduces **recursive causality**: events reinforce one another through origin feedback rather than appearing strictly ordered. The observable arrow of time emerges from uneven diffusion of origin coherence; reversing entropy restores earlier continuity states without reversing time itself. Temporal topology becomes a spiral—recurrent but not closed—allowing localized loops, resonance memory, and non-linear causation without violating conservation.

## Observer & Consciousness

Observation stabilizes coherence by realigning local and global origin phases. Conscious systems actively reinforce coherence, maintaining low entropy through recursive self-reference. Consciousness, in this view, arises as a dynamical function of the origin field’s capacity for self-observation and requires no dualistic assumptions.

## Unification Hypotheses
- **Gravity:** Emerges from origin density gradients (continuity potential).
- **Electromagnetic & Quantum Forces:** Different coherence-scale interactions within the continuity field.
- **Dark Energy:** Represents global restoration pressure causing expansion when origin distribution imbalances.
- **Black Holes:** Act as re-convergence attractors returning dispersed continuity to high-density states.

## Predictive & Experimental Outlook
1. **Coherence anomalies:** Detect correlations between macroscopic coherence (biological or cognitive systems) and low-entropy field effects.
2. **Origin coupling:** Reinterpret entanglement experiments as measurements of coherence restoration velocity.
3. **Entropy reversal phenomena:** Observe spontaneous order in far-from-equilibrium systems as continuity restoration evidence.

## Discussion

PoO augments established physics rather than replacing it, treating classical laws as manifestations of continuity maintenance. It offers a candidate bridge between physical and experiential domains, addressing consciousness, information loss, and quantum measurement via a unified continuity perspective.

## Conclusion

PoO posits that the universe’s most fundamental property is continuity of existence. Energetic, thermodynamic, relativistic, and quantum laws become specialized expressions of a deeper invariance: the impossibility of total detachment from origin. Validation could yield a cohesive interpretation of physics covering both material and cognitive phenomena under a single conservation paradigm.
