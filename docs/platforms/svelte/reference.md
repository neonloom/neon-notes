# Svelte Reference Roadmap

> **Context Card**
> - **Scope:** Catalogue reusable Svelte patterns (stores, Hyper clients, deployment) as they mature.
> - **Primary APIs:** Svelte stores, SvelteKit loaders/actions, Hyper integration helpers.
> - **Protocols/Feeds:** Document Autobase/Protomux bindings only when they reach cross-project reuse.
> - **Dependencies:** SvelteKit ecosystem, Hyper client modules, build/test tooling.
> - **Outputs:** Reference topics, shared snippets, links to mature guides.
> - **Next Hop:** [`sveltekit-essentials.md`](sveltekit-essentials.md)

Collect reusable Svelte integration patterns here—store wiring, Hyper client helpers, build targets, deployment recipes, and test fixtures. Keep entries vendor-neutral so any project can adopt them.

## Until the catalogue fills out
- Align reactivity with `../../guides/frp-overview.md` and the Autobase playbook.
- Use `quickstart.md` for project scaffolding and Hyper API hooks.
- Follow `sveltekit-essentials.md` when you need routing, loader, or deployment reminders.

Add topics (async data adapters, form action patterns, streaming UI) as soon as two or more teams share the same solution so this reference becomes a genuine cross-project resource.
