# Neon Notes

Personal Hyper stack handbook for Dagify, Autobase, URI tooling, Virtualia platforms, and related playbooks. This repo is optimized for fast recall (humans or LLMs) with a single navigation hub at `docs/index.md`.

## Structure
- `docs/index.md` — master navigation; update when paths change.
- `docs/guides/` — workflows and playbooks (Autobase, Corestore namespaces, swarm interplay).
- `docs/reference/` — APIs and deep dives (Dagify nodes, NeonURI, Hyper URI Resolver, Hyper primitives, PoO).
- `docs/platforms/` — platform notes (Pear, Bare, Svelte, Neonplex).
- `docs/walkthroughs/` — step-by-step runbooks.
- `docs/examples/` — code samples and recipes.
- `docs/meta/` — authoring and retrieval practices.
- `inbox/` — incoming material before curation.

## Usage
1) Start at `docs/index.md` to find the doc you need.
2) Keep new docs in `docs/` and add a link in `docs/index.md`.
3) Use `docs/templates/` when drafting new content for consistency.

## Repo state
- Default branch: `main`
- Remote: `git@github.com:neonloom/neon-notes.git`

Contributions in this private handbook should stay concise, link-rich, and oriented toward reuse across projects.
